      "=== Origin ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The oldest known literary mention of a \"Golden Age\" of piracy is from 1894, when the English journalist George Powell wrote about \"What appears to have been the golden age of piracy up to the last decade of the 17th century.\"  Powell uses the phrase while reviewing Charles Leslie's A New and Exact History of Jamaica, then over 150 years old. Powell uses the phrase only once.\n",
      "In 1897, a more systematic use of the phrase \"Golden Age of Piracy\" was introduced by historian John Fiske, who wrote, \"At no other time in the world's history has the business of piracy thriven so greatly as in the seventeenth century and the first part of the eighteenth. Its golden age may be said to have extended from about 1650 to about 1720.\"  Fiske included the activities of the Barbary corsairs and East Asian pirates in this \"Golden Age,\" noting that \"as these Mussulman pirates and those of Eastern Asia were as busily at work in the seventeenth century as at any other time, their case does not impair my statement that the age of the buccaneers was the Golden Age of piracy.\"\n",
      "Pirate historians of the first half of the 20th century occasionally adopted Fiske's term \"Golden Age,\" without necessarily following his beginning and ending dates for it.  The most expansive definition of an age of piracy was that of Patrick Pringle, who wrote in 1951 that \"the most flourishing era in the history of piracy ... began in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and ended in the second decade of the eighteenth century.\"  This idea starkly contradicted Fiske, who had hotly denied that such Elizabethan figures as Drake were pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Trend toward narrow definitions ===\n",
      "Of recent definitions, that given by Pringle appears to have the widest range, an exception to an overall trend among historians from 1909 until the 1990s, toward narrowing the Golden Age.  As early as 1924, Philip Gosse described piracy as being at its height \"from 1680 until 1730.\" In his highly popular 1978 book The Pirates for TimeLife's The Seafarers series, Douglas Botting defined the Golden Age as lasting \"barely 30 years, starting at the close of the 17th Century and ending in the first quarter of the 18th.\"  Botting's definition was closely followed by Frank Sher\n",

      "Final Answer:\n",
      "Google's environmental initiatives focus on several key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Empowering Individuals**: Google aims to help people make sustainable choices through features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, energy efficiency options in Google Nest thermostats, and carbon emissions information in Google Flights. In 2022, they achieved their goal to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Working Together**: Google collaborates with partners and customers to promote sustainability. They are involved in various coalitions and initiatives, such as the iMasons Climate Accord for carbon reduction and the ReFED Catalytic Grant Fund to address food waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Operating Sustainably**: Google has committed to achieving net-zero carbon and has initiatives in place for water stewardship and circular economy practices. They also focus on responsible supply chain management, requiring suppliers to report environmental data and adhere to sustainability standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data and Technology Utilization**: Google leverages its technology and platforms to support sustainability efforts, including monitoring environmental changes and optimizing resource use. They have developed tools to help organizations enhance their sustainability practices through data analytics and machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Innovative Projects and Grants**: Google supports various environmental projects, including reforestation efforts and initiatives to prevent deforestation. They also invest in sustainability-focused startups through programs like Google for Startups Accelerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Google is actively working to reduce its environmental impact while empowering others to do the same through innovative technologies and strategic partnerships.\n",
