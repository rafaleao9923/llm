**Leverage Python to control and automate high-quality AI image generation using Stable Diffusion**

## What is this book about?

This book shows you how to use Python to control Stable Diffusion and generate high-quality images. In addition to covering the basic usage of the diffusers package, the book provides solutions for extending the package for more advanced purposes.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore core concepts and applications of Stable Diffusion and set up your environment for success
* Refine performance, manage VRAM usage, and leverage community-driven resources like LoRAs and textual inversion
* Harness the power of ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other methodologies to generate images with unprecedented control and quality
* Explore developments in Stable Diffusion such as video generation using AnimateDiff
* Write effective prompts and leverage LLMs to automate the process
* Discover how to train a Stable Diffusion LoRA from scratch

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
# load model
text2img_pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stablediffusionapi/deliberate-v2",
    torch_dtype = torch.float16
).to("cuda:0")
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

Complete with step-by-step explanation and exploration of Stable Diffusion model with Python, you will start to understand how Stable Diffusion works and how the source code is organized to make your own advanced features, or even build one of your own complete standalone Stable Diffusion application.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-21).
