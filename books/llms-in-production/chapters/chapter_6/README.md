# Chapter 6

A note on setup. Due to dependency issues, listings related to use the feature store feast, have been moved into their own requirements file. We recommend you set up a new environment to run these listings.

```bash
conda create -n feast python=3.10 --yes
conda activate feast
pip install -r requirements_feast.txt
```
